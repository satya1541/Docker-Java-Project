## Overview
This guide will take you step-by-step through the process of building and deploying a Java web application using Tomcat, Maven, and Docker. By the end, youâ€™ll have a fully functional Java app packaged as a WAR file and running inside a Tomcat server hosted within a Docker container.

Letâ€™s dive in!

---

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Docker**:  
  Install Docker with the following commands:  
  ```bash
  yum install docker -y
  systemctl start docker
  ```

- **Maven**:  
  Install Maven and other dependencies:  
  ```bash
  yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven tree -y
  ```

- **Java**:  
  Make sure you have **JDK 11** installed, as itâ€™s required for this project.

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Java Application

First, ensure your Java project is structured properly, with a `pom.xml` file configured for Maven. Once ready, you can package your application into a WAR file. Run the following Maven command to build your project:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This command will generate the `NETFLIX-1.2.2.war` file in the `target` directory of your project.

---

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

Next, you need to containerize your Java app. In the root directory of your project, create a file named **Dockerfile** and add the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM tomcat:9.0-jdk11-adoptopenjdk-hotspot

LABEL maintainer="satya"

WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat

COPY target/NETFLIX-1.2.2.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war

EXPOSE 8080

ENV JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx1024m"

CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
```

### Key Points:
- This Dockerfile is based on the official **Tomcat 9** image with **JDK 11**.
- The WAR file generated by Maven is copied to the Tomcat `webapps` directory.
- The `catalina.sh` script starts the Tomcat server when the container runs.

---

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Now, it's time to build your Docker image. Navigate to the directory where your **Dockerfile** is located and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-tomcat-app .
```

- `-t my-tomcat-app`: Tags your image with the name **my-tomcat-app**.
- `.`: Refers to the current directory, which contains the Dockerfile.

---

## Step 4: Run the Docker Container

With your image built, you can now run a container from it. Use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name my-tomcat-container my-tomcat-app
```

### Explanation:
- `-d`: Runs the container in the background (detached mode).
- `-p 8080:8080`: Maps port **8080** on your machine to port **8080** inside the container.
- `--name my-tomcat-container`: Gives the running container a custom name.
- `my-tomcat-app`: The image name you just built.

---

## Step 5: Access Your Application

Once the container is running, you can access your Java web app by opening a browser and navigating to:

```url
http://<PublicIP>:8080
```

This will load your Java application, deployed as the **NETFLIX-1.2.2.war** file in Tomcat.

---

## Additional Docker Commands

Here are some helpful Docker commands for managing your container:

- **Stop the container**:
  ```bash
  docker stop my-tomcat-container
  ```

- **Remove the container**:
  ```bash
  docker rm my-tomcat-container
  ```

- **View running containers**:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- **View logs (including Tomcat logs)**:
  ```bash
  docker logs my-tomcat-container
  ```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve successfully built and deployed a Java web application inside a Docker container using Tomcat and Maven. Now you can manage and scale your app using Docker, while keeping the deployment process streamlined.  

Keep experimenting, and happy coding! ðŸš€
