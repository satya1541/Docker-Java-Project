# Docker-Java-Project

Overview:-

This guide will walk you through building and running a Java web application using Tomcat, Maven, and Docker. The project will include packaging the app as a WAR file and deploying it to a Tomcat server inside a Docker container.

Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Docker: Install Docker  yum install docker -y | systemctl start docker
Maven: Install Maven    yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven tree -y 
Java: JDK 11 (required for your project).
Step 1: Prepare Your Java Application
Ensure your Java project is correctly structured and that you have a Maven pom.xml file configured.
Build the WAR file using Maven by running the following command:

bash

Copy code

mvn clean package

This will generate the NETFLIX-1.2.2.war file in the target directory.

Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

In the root directory of your project, create a file named Dockerfile and add the following content:

Dockerfile

FROM tomcat:9.0-jdk11-adoptopenjdk-hotspot

LABEL maintainer="satya"

WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat

COPY target/NETFLIX-1.2.2.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war

EXPOSE 8080

ENV JAVA_OPTS="-Xms512m -Xmx1024m"

CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]


Key Points:

This Dockerfile uses the official Tomcat image with JDK 11.
The WAR file generated by Maven is copied to the Tomcat webapps directory.
Tomcat will run when the container starts.
Step 3: Build the Docker Image
Navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located.

Run the following command to build your Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-tomcat-app .
-t my-tomcat-app: This tags the image with the name my-tomcat-app.
.: Refers to the current directory where the Dockerfile is located.
Step 4: Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, you can create and run a container from this image:

Run the container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name my-tomcat-container my-tomcat-app
-d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
-p 8080:8080: Maps port 8080 on your host machine to port 8080 inside the container.
--name my-tomcat-container: Names the running container my-tomcat-container.
my-tomcat-app: The Docker image to run.
Step 5: Access the Application
Once the container is running, open a web browser and navigate to:

Arduino

Copy code

http://PublicIP:8080

This should load your Java web application, deployed as the NETFLIX-1.2.2.war file.

Additional Docker Commands
Here are a few helpful commands for managing your container:

Stop the container:

bash
Copy code
docker stop my-tomcat-container
Remove the container:

bash
Copy code
docker rm my-tomcat-container
View running containers:

bash
Copy code
docker ps
View logs (to see Tomcat logs):

bash
Copy code
docker logs my-tomcat-container
Conclusion
You have successfully built a Docker image containing your Tomcat-based Java web application and deployed it to a container. You can now access your app through your browser and manage it using Docker commands.
